    "summary": "I am a full stack web developer focused on building software that creates value for users and stakeholders. While pursuing my degree in Computer Science, I have co-founded Aprimoramente, a company which helps people find where to learn in Brazil. I worked there as the single developer since and now am ready for the next step in my career. I believe in understanding the real needs the software I write addresses and the impact of technical decisions, and my experience has given me an awareness of the full context the code I write exists in. I love solving problems and debugging, learning new technologies, and most of all building great software.",
